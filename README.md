#Menu Manager

Ultra basic server to manage a small database of menu items and an API endpoint to access them.

The menu-maker library creates JSON files from parsed pdfs and scraped web pages. Unfortunately, each restaurant/menu needs a bespoke parser. Running the web scrapping parsers requires an active geckodriver instance.
